# hotel-booking-analysis

my first project

Created the business objective for project and find out the problem statement

#loaded the liabraries and data

 dataset has 119390 rows and 32 columns. There are no null values in any columns except for 4 columns(children,country,agent,company). The dataset also have 31994 duplicate values

renamed the values in is_canceled column

 it has been noticed that city hotels(61.44%) are preferred mostly by the people rather than resort hotel(38.56%)

Noticed that online platform is the most preferred plat form for booking hotel,followed by offline and direct

The bookings from online(51,543) channel are more compared to offline(13,857),direct(11,647),groups(4,937),corporate(4,031),complementary(698) and aviation(227)

Came across that city_hotel is canceled most(16041),compared to Resort_hotel(7946)

Maximum hotels are not taking any deposits from the customers,may be that might be the reason to high cancelation

It is found that most of the customers are not_repeated(83,529), compared to repeated(3,411)

Sales are highest in the year 2016, than followed by the year 2017

observed that customers are highest in the month of August, than followed by july

aarivals are more for city_hotel than resort_hotel,more focused should be on city_hotel to increase the revenue

Noticed that most number of arrivals are in August(12.92%) followed by July(11.53%),May(9.60%),April(9.05%) and June(8.92%),we can clearly observe that most number of arrivals are in summer season,so we can say summer is peak season

Meal BB is preferred most in both Resort_hotel and City_hotel,followed by HB,interesting is Meal SC is preferred by only City_hotel, resort_hotel Meal_type SC is negligible

city_hotel has more adr(Average daily rate) compare to Resort_hotel.

Resort_hotel prices are highly fluctuating compare to city_hotel,the highest price of Resort_hotel was in August and low was in (November and January) were as city_hotel prices were highest in August and lowest in January.
