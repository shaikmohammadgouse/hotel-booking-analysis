# hotel-booking-analysis

my first project

Created the business objective for project and find out the problem statement

#loaded the liabraries and data

 dataset has 119390 rows and 32 columns. There are no null values in any columns except for 4 columns(children,country,agent,company). The dataset also have 31994 duplicate values

renamed the values in is_canceled column

 it has been noticed that city hotels(61.44%) are preferred mostly by the people rather than resort hotel(38.56%)

Noticed that online platform is the most preferred plat form for booking hotel,followed by offline and direct
